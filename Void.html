		<p>This is the first game I ever made with a couple of friends.  It has gone through 
		many changes has used many different libs.  This is a version that is complety in java
		no external libs, in other words it is a very early version of the game.  It has tons 
		of bugs and isn't all that fun but it is a game.  The goal
		is to get as high of score as you can by destroying the enemy and not getting killed.</p>
